There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.
- the local variable is declared inside block or function
- the global variable is accessible from any function
 <br>
 Rules of declaring the variables:
 - Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
 - After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
 - JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.
 
 let x = 10;

 let _x = 10;

 let $ = 10;
