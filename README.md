## **Introduction**

### **The founder of JavaScript**

## **Variables**

A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location.

There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.
- the local variable is declared inside block or function
- the global variable is accessible from any function
 <br>
 Rules of declaring the variables: <br>
 - Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
 - After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
 - JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.
 <br>
 
 let x = 10;

 let _x = 10;

 let $ = 10;

## **Data types: primitive and object**
JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.

Primitive data type
Non-primitive (reference) data type <br>

## ** Conditions:if/else, switch statement, ternary operator**
Conditional Statements
Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.
You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
<br>
 if, if/else
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}
<br>
 switch case
